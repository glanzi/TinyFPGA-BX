# TinyFPGA-UP

The TinyFPGA UP board is a tiny FPGA board based on a ICE40UP5K-SG48 FPGA from Lattice.

This board is based on Luke Valenty's [TinyFPGA-BX](https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-BX) project.
The programming pins are compatible with Piotr Esden-Tempski's [iCEBreaker-bitsy](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker) project.

WARNING: This is work in progress and not yet soldered nor tested!
